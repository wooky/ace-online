Ace of Penguins.

http://www.delorie.com/store/ace/ is the Ace Home Page.

DJ Delorie <dj@delorie.com> is the primary author.

Martin Thornquist did the thornq and canfield games.

Mark Arrasmith <arrasmith@math.twsu.edu> ported Ace to the Linux
Agenda VR3 (and inspired me to do the gif->png conversion and dynamic
sizing).
