For native Unix:

./configure
make
make install


You can use "./configure --disable-shared" to build statically linked games.



For the Agenda PDA:

./configure --with-cross=mipsel-linux
make

mipsel-linux-strip -x libs/.lib/libcard.so.0.0.0
mipsel-linux-strip games/.lib/*
copy libs/.lib/libcard.so* to /usr/local/lib on the agenda.
as agenda's root run /sbin/ldconfig
copy games/.lib/* to /usr/local/bin (or wherever)
