<p>The goal of <tt>mastermind</tt> is to guess what the hidden color
sequence (at the top) is.  If you guess the sequence, or run out of
turns, the hidden sequence is shown. </p>

<p>My personal goal is to make money and have fun! <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Use the mouse (either button) to drag colors from the palette (on
the left) or from another guess to the empty cells in the topmost
guess row.  When all four cells are full, click in the rank area (the
right) to see how you did.  There will be one black peg for each cell
that is the correct color, and one white for colors that is not in the
correct sequence.</p>

<p>You may drag new colors onto filled cells to change the color
before asking for your rank.</p>

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The <tt>R O Y G B V</tt> keys fill in the leftmost empty cell with
that color.  The <tt>Return</tt> key asks to have your guess ranked.</p>

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.
