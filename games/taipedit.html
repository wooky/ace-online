<h1>Purpose</h1>
<h2>The Purpose</h2>

<p><tt>taipedit</tt> is a layout editor for <tt>taipei.</tt> While <tt>taipei</tt>
has nine layouts built in, it's fun to design your own layouts and use
those.</p>

<p>The file format is a list of numbers.  A negative number means that
that number and the next two are an x,y,z coordinate of a tile (using
the absolute value of x).  A positive number is a new x coordinate,
and the previosu y and z coordinates are re-used.</p>

<p>Note that the output file format is also used to compile the
built-in layouts.</p>

<h1>Screen</h1>
<h2>Stuff You'll See On The Screen</h2>

<p>Layer selector:<br>
<img align=center src=taipedit-bu> Layers that are not shown. <br>
<img align=center src=taipedit-bt> Layer that is editable. <br>
<img align=center src=taipedit-bs> Layers that are shown but not editable. </p>

<p>Tiles:<br>
<img align=center src=t/n1> . . . <img align=center src=t/n8>
Tiles are numbered according to the layer they're on</p>

<p>You'll also see a count of the number of tiles above the layer
selector; multiples of four are recommended, but only multiples of two
are required.  You must give between 2 and 144 tiles.</p>

<h1>Editing</h1>
<h2>How to Edit the Layout</h2>

<p>One layer is selected for edit at a time using the stack of buttons
on the right edge of the window, or by pressing the corresponding
digit key on the keyboard.  Layers above the selected layer are not
shown so that you can see what you're doing.</p>

<p>Within the grid, the <b>left</b> mouse button adds tiles and the
<b>right</b> mouse button removes them.  You can hold the buttons
while holding the mouse; it will add/remove multiple tiles.</p>

<p>You would normally specify a file name on the command line.  The
<tt>l</tt> key reloads this file to the window.  The <tt>s</tt> key
saves the current layout to the file.  The <tt>q</tt> key quits.</p>

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The number keys <tt>1..8</tt> select that layer.</p>

<p>The up, down, left, and right arrows shift the entire layout one
step in that direction.  The page up and down keys shift the layout
up/down one layer.  The Home key centers the layout in the window.
<tt>S</tt> saves the layout, <tt>L</tt> reloads it.</p>

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the program.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for help's
title).  Letters show section starting with that letter.
