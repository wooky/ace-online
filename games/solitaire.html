<h1>Goal</h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>

<img align=right src=empty>

<p>The goal of <tt>solitaire</tt> is to move all the cards to the four
stacks in the upper right of the window.</p>

<p>My personal goal is to make money and have fun! <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>You may flip one card at a time off the <i>deck</i> (upper left,
face down) onto the <i>hole</i> next to it (face up).  When the deck
is empty, click on that spot again and the hole's cards are moved back
to the deck, and you start flipping again.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the window, you may move any card onto another
card if the card you move is a different color and the next lower
value (ace is one, king is 13).  You may move
stacks of cards in this sequence onto other cards to grow these
stacks.</p>

<p>You may place one card at a time onto the <i>output</i> stacks in
the upper right.  Aces may go onto any empty output stack.  Other cards
must go onto the same suit and in ascending order (ace, 2, etc, king).

<h1>Mouse</h1>
<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>

<p>The <b>left</b> button is used to move cards around.  Move the
mouse over the card, press and hold the left button, and move the
mouse.  The cards follow the mouse.  Note that the number of cards you
carry automatically varies as you move it over the various stacks;
this indicates how many cards you may drop on that stack.</p>

<p>If you click the left mouse button twice quickly without moving the
mouse <i>(double clicking),</i> the computer will move what it can
from what you clicked on to wherever it can go, if there is an obvious
choice.</p>

<p>The <b>right</b> button can be used to "peek" at an obscured
card.</p>

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.

<h1>Credits</h1>

<p>The Ace of Penguins system was written by me, DJ Delorie, so that
my wife Pat could play her favorite Windows 95 games on my Linux laptop.
She gets credit for <i>hours</i> of testing <tt>;-)</tt></p>

<p>Many thanks to the SGI, Linux, and GNU developers, for the tools
and systems I use.</p>
