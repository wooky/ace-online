<h2>The Goal</h2>

<img align=right src=empty>

<p>The goal of <tt>thornq</tt> is to move all the cards to the four
stacks in the upper right of the window.</p>


<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>You may move any card facing up in one of the eight <i>main
stacks</i> onto one of the other main stacks following suit and in
descending order moving along <i>any</i> cards that are on top of the one
you move.  The cards you are moving do <b>not</b> have to be in
order!</p>

<p>You may place one card at a time onto the <i>output</i> stacks in
the upper right.  Aces may go onto any empty output stack.  Other
cards must go onto the same suit and in ascending order (ace, 2, etc,
king).  Note that the computer does this for you automatically.</p>

<h1>Mouse</h1>
<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>

<p>The <b>left</b> button is used to move cards around.  Move the
mouse over the card, press and hold the left button, and move the
mouse.  The cards follow the mouse.</p>

<p>If you click the left mouse button twice quickly without moving the
mouse <i>(double clicking),</i> the computer will Attempt to do "the
right thing" - if you double click on the bottom card, it tries to
find the card that goes on it, else it tries to move the card you
double clicked on to the bottom of another stack.</p>

<p>The <b>right</b> button can be used to "peek" at an obscured
card.</p>


<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The spacebar tells the computer to do "the right thing".  The
<tt>a</tt> key gives you a hint, the <tt>A</tt> key toggles auto-hint
mode.

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> and <tt>r</tt> keys restart the game.  The <tt>F1</tt>
and <tt>h</tt> keys show this help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.

<h2>Credits</h2>
