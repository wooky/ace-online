<h1>Goal</h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of Minesweeper is to correctly flag all the mines and
uncover all the other squares.</p>

<p>When you are uncovering a square, the penguin is scared.</p>

<p>When you lose, the penguin is sad.</p>

<p>When you wins, the penguin puts on cool sunglasses.</p>

<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Some of the squares have land mines (bombs) under them.  Use the
left mouse button to select squares.  If there is a bomb under the
square you select, you lose.  If not, the uncovered square may have a
number in it - if so, then that many of that square's neighbors have
bombs in them (you don't know which).  Use logic to figure out which
have mines and which don't.</p>

<p>The right mouse button is used to "tag" covered squares.  You can
tag a square with a flag (to indicate that you think there's a mine
there) or with a question mark (which is just a reminder to you if you
want it).  Keep clicking to change the tags.  Right-clicking on an
uncovered square will automatically flag or uncover adjacent squares
if the computer can determine that it's safe to do so.</p>

<h1>Mouse</h1>
<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>

<p>The <b>left</b> button uncovers squares.  If you left-click on the
penguin, it restarts the game.</p>

<p>The <b>right</b> button flags (or tags or unflags) covered squares.
If you right-click on a numbered square, the computer may
automatically flag or uncover adjacent squares if it can safely do so.
Right-clicking on the penguin will make the computer auto-play as far
as it safely can.</p>

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The <tt>1..4</tt> keys select the game skill level (1 is easiest).
The <tt>a</tt> key auto-plays.  The <tt>6..9</tt> keys demonstrate
the penguin's various poses.</p>

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.
