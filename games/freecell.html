<h1>Goal</h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>

<img align=right src=empty>

<p>The goal of <tt>freecell</tt> is to move all the cards to the four
stacks in the upper right of the window.</p>

<p>My personal goal is to make money and have fun! <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>You may move the bottom most card from any of the <i>main
stacks</i> (the eight stacks of cards taking up most of the window) to
any empty <i>free cell</i> (the four in the upper left).  Free cells
may only hold one card at a time.</p>

<p>You may move any card from another main stack or free cell onto one
of the main stacks if the card you move is a different color than the
bottom card on that stack and the next lower value (ace is one, king
is 13).  You may move stacks of cards in this sequence onto other
cards to grow these stacks.</p>

<p>Note that you are limited in the number of cards you may move at
once!  The actual rules are that you may not move more than <i>one</i>
card at a time; moving a stack involves temporarily storing cards in
the free cells or empty main stacks.  Moves that otherwise would be
allowed may not be if there aren't enough temporary places to hold
cards during the move.  The computer figures all this out
internally.</p>

<p>You may place one card at a time onto the <i>output</i> stacks in
the upper right.  Aces may go onto any empty output stack.  Other cards
must go onto the same suit and in ascending order (ace, 2, etc, king).

<h1>Mouse</h1>
<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>

<p>The <b>left</b> button is used to move cards around.  Move the
mouse over the card, press and hold the left button, and move the
mouse.  The cards follow the mouse.  Note that the number of cards you
carry automatically varies as you move it over the various stacks;
this indicates how many cards you may drop on that stack.</p>

<p>If you click the left mouse button twice quickly without moving the
mouse <i>(double clicking or space bar),</i> the computer will make
a (hopefully) useful move for you, if it can.</p>

<p>The <b>right</b> button can be used to "peek" at an obscured
card.</p>

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.
