<h1>Goal</h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>

<img align=right src=empty>

<p>The goal of <tt>spider</tt> is to move all the cards to the eight
stacks in the upper right of the window.</p>

<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p> Build down regardless of suit.  Sequences of cards in the same 
suit can be moved as a unit.  Empty piles can be filled with any 
card or legal sequence.</p>

<p>Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every
pile.  However, all piles must be non-empty.  If an empty pile exists,
an error message will appear.</p>

<p>A sequence of cards going down from King down to Ace can be moved to 
a foundation pile.  Once there, these cards are no longer in play.</p>

<h1>Options</h1>

<h2>One Suit : <i>press 1</i></h2>
<p>The deck is an octuple deck of Hearts only. This is the simplest of 
the spider decks and a good way to learn the basics.</p>

<h2>Two Suits : <i>press 2</i></h2>
<p>The deck is a quadruple deck of Hearts and Clubs only. There are 
four complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is not quite as 
diabolical as the standard four suit spider deck.</p>

<h2>Four Suits : <i>press 4</i></h2>
<p>The deck is a standard double deck. There are two complete sequences 
of cards for each suit. This is the standard Spider deck. It is also the 
most difficult.</p>


<h1>Mouse</h1>
<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>

<p>The <b>left</b> button is used to move cards around.  Move the
mouse over the card, press and hold the left button, and move the
mouse.  The cards follow the mouse.  Note that the number of cards you
carry automatically varies as you move it over the various stacks;
this indicates how many cards you may drop on that stack.</p>

<p>The <b>right</b> button can be used to "peek" at an obscured
card.</p>

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>The "<tt>1</tt>" key selects the "One Suit" version of spider.</p>

<p>The "<tt>2</tt>" key selects the "Two Suits" version of spider.</p>

<p>The "<tt>4</tt>" key selects the "Ffour Suits" version of spider.</p>

<p>The "<tt>a</tt>" key toggles the suggestion arrows.</p>

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.
