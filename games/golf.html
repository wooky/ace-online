<h1>Goal</h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of <tt>golf</tt> is to move all the cards to the
row of cards at the bottom (the <i>discard</i>).

<p>My personal goal is to make money and have fun! <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>The <i>deck</i> is in the lower left corner.  The <i>stacks</i> are
on the top.  The <i>discard</i> is the row of cards along the bottom.

<p>Use the mouse to select either the top card from any stack (ok, it's
the one closest to the bottom of the window on each stack) or from the
deck.  Each card you select is moved to the top of the discard row
(the first card is there already).  You may only select a card from
the stacks if the value of that card is one more or less than the top
card on the discard, but you may always select a card from the deck.

<p>As a special rule, you may not place any card on a king.

<h1>Mouse</h1>
<h2>Using the Mouse</h2>

<p>The <b>left</b> button selects cards, either from the stacks or
from the deck.

<p>The <b>right</b> button selects a card from the deck, regardless of
where the mouse is.

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The <tt>Backspace</tt> key can be used to undo moves.

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.
