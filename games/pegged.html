<h1>Goal</h1>
<h2>The Goal</h2>

<img align=right src=pegged-p>

<p>The goal of <tt>pegged</tt> is to remove all but one of the pegs
from the board.  Ideally, this peg should be in the hole that was
empty at the start of the game.  </p>

<p>My personal goal is to make money and have fun! <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<h1>Play</h1>
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Hole = <img align=center src=pegged-h>
<img align=center src=pegged-p> = Peg</p>

<p>Use the mouse (either button) to drag pegs to make them "jump" over
an adjacent peg into an empty hole, making the jumpped peg disappear.
When only one peg remains, you win.  When more than one remain but no
jumps are possible, you lose.</p>

<p>Note that the cross-shaped games do not allow diagonal jumps.</p>

<p>If all the holes have pegs in them, click on any one to remove it
and start the game.</p>

<h1>Keys</h1>
<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>

<p>The numbers <tt>1..9</tt>select games.  <tt>1..7</tt> are square
games (easy to hard) and <tt>8..9</tt> are triangle games.
The backspace key "undoes" your previous moves.</p>

<p>The <tt>q</tt> <tt>Esc</tt> and <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> keys quit the game.
The <tt>F2</tt> key restarts the game.  The <tt>F1</tt> key shows this
help.

<p>When viewing help, the space bar, <tt>F1</tt> or <tt>Esc</tt>
return you to your game.  Numbers show that section (0 for any
pre-header section).  Letters show section starting with that letter.
